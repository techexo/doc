# Install wallabag on your own server

{% hint style="info"}
If you're here, it means that you have a Linux/UNIX server running with [all the requirements met](readme.md) and an administrator access to it (`root` or `www-data` privileges). If you plan to install wallabag on a commercial web hosting service, please refer to the [relevant section of the documentation](installation_webhosting.md).
